        <p>From food to architecture to breathtaking landscapes, it's easy to see why Florence was the cultural epicenter of the Renaissance. Truth be told, there's far too much to see in any one trip. But if you hit these spots along your journey, you're doing Florence right.</p>
        
        <br>
        
        <h3>Food</h3>

        <p>Let's kick it off with three restaurants you simply cannot miss.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>All'antico Vinaio
            <li>Perch√© no!
            <li>La Buchetta
        </ul>
        
        <br>
        
        <h3>Cathedrals</h3>

        <p>The moment you arrive in Florence, one this is strikingly apparent: this place goes to church. Here are three you can't miss!</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Santa Maria del Fiore (Duomo)
            <li>Santa Croce
            <li>Santa maria del Carmine
        </ul>
        
        <br>
        
        <h3>Art & Adventures</h3>
        
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/%27David%27_by_Michelangelo_Fir_JBU002.jpg/220px-%27David%27_by_Michelangelo_Fir_JBU002.jpg" width="200">
        
        <p>There are too many great works of art to see in Florence. Heck, you could spend a year there and only scratch the surface. And beyond the art, there are amazing works of architecture and landscaping at every turn. With that in mind, here are three excursions you can take during your time in Florence that will help tame the FOMO.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Michelangelo's David
            <li>The Uffizi
            <li>Boboli Gardens
        </ul>
       
        <br>
        
        <p>That's all I care to share for now, but know that there are countless untold adventures awaiting you down the winding, medieval streets of Florence. <strong>Andiamo!</strong></p>
